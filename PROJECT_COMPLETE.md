## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Extensibility First

The extension is designed to be easily extended with new features:

```typescript
// Core Interfaces (src/core/types.ts)
interface IWatcher {
    start(): Promise<void>;
    stop(): void;
    isActive(): boolean;
}

interface INotifier {
    notify(message: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface ISoundPlayer {
    canPlay(): boolean;
    play(soundPath?: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Modular Structure

```
src/
├── core/          → Interfaces and types
├── config/        → Configuration management
├── watchers/      → Event source implementations
├── notifiers/     → Notification implementations
├── sound/         → Sound player implementations
├── utils/         → Shared utilities
└── extension.ts   → Main orchestration
```

This structure makes it trivial to add:
- **New watchers**: HTTP webhooks, log tailing, process monitoring
- **New notifiers**: Rich notifications, external webhooks, integrations
- **New sound players**: Custom formats, text-to-speech

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (4 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the extension
npm run build

# 3. Open in VS Code/Cursor
code .  # or: cursor .

# 4. Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

Then test with: **Cmd+Shift+P** → "Cursor Helper: Test Notification"

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Interface-Based Architecture**
Every major component implements an interface, making it easy to add new implementations without changing existing code.

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
Each module has a single responsibility:
- `ConfigManager`: Configuration only
- `FileWatcher`: File watching only
- `VSCodeNotifier`: Notifications only
- `SoundPlayer`: Sound playback only

### 3. **Event-Driven Communication**
Components communicate via events, reducing coupling:
```typescript
configManager.onConfigChange(config => {
    // React to changes
});
```

### 4. **Cross-Platform from Day One**
Platform-specific code is abstracted behind interfaces with factory pattern.

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Hot-reload for configuration changes
- F5 debug support out of the box
- Extensive documentation

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancement Roadmap

The architecture supports these enhancements without major refactoring:

### Near Term
- [ ] Status bar integration
- [ ] Multiple flag file support
- [ ] Rich notifications with action buttons
- [ ] Rate limiting for rapid events

### Medium Term
- [ ] HTTP webhook mode
- [ ] Log file tailing mode
- [ ] Per-workspace settings
- [ ] Bundled default sounds

### Long Term
- [ ] VS Code Marketplace publication
- [ ] E2E test suite
- [ ] WebView-based settings UI
- [ ] External integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.)

All of these can be added by implementing existing interfaces!
